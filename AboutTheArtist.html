      Sufjan Stevens is an American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. He has released nine solo studio albums and multiple collaborative albums with other artists. Stevens has received Grammy and Academy Award nominations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stevens was born in Detroit, Michigan, and lived there until the age of nine, when his family moved to Alanson, Michigan, in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. He was raised by his father, Rasjid, and his stepmother, Pat, and only occasionally visited his mother, Carrie, in Oregon after she married her second husband, Lowell Brams. Brams later became the head of Stevens' record label Asthmatic Kitty, which the two would co-found together.
    </p>
    <p>
      His debut album, <i>A Sun Came</i>, was released in 2000 on the Asthmatic Kitty label. He received wide recognition for his 2005 album <i>Illinois</i>, which hit number one on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, and for the single "Chicago" from that album. Stevens later contributed to the soundtrack of the 2017 film <i>Call Me by Your Name</i>. He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song and a Grammy nomination for Best Song Written for Visual Media for the soundtrack's lead single, "Mystery of Love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stevens has released albums of varying styles, from the electronica of <i>The Age of Adz</i> and the lo-fi folk of <i>Seven Swans</i> to the symphonic instrumentation of <i>Illinois</i> and the Christmas-themed <i>Songs for Christmas</i>. He employs various instruments, often playing many of them himself on the same recording. Stevens' music is also known for exploring various themes, particularly religion and spirituality. Stevens' tenth and latest studio album, <i>A Beginner's Mind</i>, was created alongside Angelo De Augustine and released in 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stevens' sound has been most generally associated with genres such as indie folk, alternative rock, indie rock, indie pop, baroque pop, chamber pop, folk-pop, avant-garde folk, lo-fi folk, and electronica. A multi-instrumentalist, Stevens is known for his frequent use of the banjo, but also plays guitar, piano, drums, woodwinds, and several other instruments on his records, layered through the use of the multitrack recording.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stevens' work is known to explore themes of love, religion, outer space, and grief. Despite many of his songs having spiritual allusions, Stevens does not identify as a contemporary Christian music artist or frequently discuss religion with the press. He told <i>The Village Voice</i>: "I don't think music media is the real forum for theological discussions. I think I've said things and sung about things that probably weren't appropriate for this kind of form. And I just feel like it's not my work or my place to be making claims and statements because I often think it's misunderstood."
    </p>
    <p>
      During a 2004 interview with Adrian Pannett for <i>Comes with a Smile</i> magazine, when asked how important faith was to his music, he said "I don't like talking about that stuff in the public forum because, I think, certain themes and convictions are meant for personal conversation."In a 2006 interview, he said "It's not so much that faith influences us as it lives in us. In every circumstance (giving a speech or tying my shoes), I am living and moving and being.‚Äù
