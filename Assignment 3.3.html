	<p>
		As if channeling another dimension where genres simply don’t exist, Rainbow Kitten Surprise find harmony in unpredictability – weaving together lyrical poetry, hummable melodies, and a rush of instrumental eccentricities. The genre-defying band first began building their devoted fanbase with independent albums “SEVEN + MARY” (2013) and “RKS” (2015). Arriving in 2018, their full-length debut for Elektra, “HOW TO: FRIEND, LOVE, FREEFALL” – produced by GRAMMY Award-winner Jay Joyce (Cage The Elephant, Sleeper Agent) featuring RIAA-certified Gold single “It’s Called: Freefall” – earned widespread praise from Billboard, TIME, Vice, and NPR who described their sound as “…a mix of jam and indie and whatever else you can throw into the soup…very earnest, beautiful, political, loving rock n’ roll,” and several national television appearances, including performances on “CBS This Morning Saturday,” “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” and PBS’s “Austin City Limits.” After gracing the bills of Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, and Osheaga, to name a few, RKS moved 80,000 tickets of their own on their sold-out Friend, Love Freefall Tour earmarked by a packed night at Red Rocks and three consecutive gigs in Athens, GA—as chronicled on their first official live album, “LIVE FROM ATHENS GEORGIA,” released in 2021. Rainbow Kitten Surprise is: Ela Melo (lead vocals), Darrick “Bozzy” Keller (guitar, vocals), Ethan Goodpaster (lead guitar, vocals), Charlie Holt (bass, vocals), Jess Haney (drums)

	The band released a statement in mid-2022 cancelling their upcoming tour dates for the health of their lead singer, Ela: "Hey everyone – Ela here. With the heaviest of hearts, we have decided to cancel the rest of our July and August dates. After being off the last couple of years due to the pandemic, we were excited to hit the ground running with touring. As amazing as it has been singing and dancing with you every night, the toll of life on the road has finally reached its breaking point. I have decided it is in my and our best interest to take this time to regroup and focus on my mental health. Thank you for all of your concern and understanding."

	<H4><strong>History of the Band</strong></H4>
	<p>
	Rainbow Kitten Surprise was formed in 2013 by Ela Melo and Darrick Keller. The two wrote and composed music together as they attended Appalachian State University. The band name was created by a friend who was on a morphine drip at the time, recently out of surgery. Their first EP, Mary, was recorded in a dorm room at the university.They later added three new members, Ethan Goodpaster, Jess Haney, and Charlie Holt. RKS independently released its first album, Seven, which was later re-released together with the band's first EP as a joint album called Seven + Mary. RKS initially recorded its music under the Split Rail Records label, a student run label at Appalachian State University's Hayes School of Music, where three of the band's members attended. From 2014 through 2017, Rainbow Kitten Surprise has performed at multiple music festivals and other events, including Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival and Austin City Limits Festival.

	If you have never listened to Rainbow Kitten Surprise before, I would recommend starting with their first album, <em> Seven + Mary </em>. It has a large amount of their greatest hits, including my personal favorite, "First Class." I have attached the link to their Spotify account for a good place to start. In fact, here's a review from the website <em> Sputnik Music </em> for more information.

	Rainbow Kitten Surprise is potentially the strangest name this band could’ve picked. They have no stylistic similarity to other bands with absurd monikers. There are no vocoders or wild electronics (Black Moth Super Rainbow). There are no cutesy pop anthems. There is, quite frankly, nothing strange. They are simply an excellent indie rock band with some folk-leaning tendencies. Their first offering, Seven + Mary, a joint album and EP, exemplifies that uncomplicated, easy-listening sound. In fact, RKS’s sound is so smooth and predictable that they appear expendable at first listen. Fortunately, upon closer observation, the band proves their mettle. Their true prowess lies in their expert lyricism and wordplay. Take the standout titular track “Seven”. Its chorus plays out in two parts. The first is a countdown: “Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one / Everybody’s got a name, everybody’s got a number”. The second then captures the song’s melancholy theme of the loss of a lover: “Seven sins, six frames, five for the two of us / Three’s too much if there’s only one love”. Aside from the “two-too” play, the order of numbers encapsulates the desired order of the lost relationship. In contrast, the song’s strife and illusions to infidelity center around deception, unpredictability, and disorder (all common themes in the project) with desperate and disparate voices. While this is the best example, RKS universally packs extreme density and complexity into simple songs.
